# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Image-Classifier
This project involves developing a machine learning/deep learning model to classify images of hand gestures into one of three categories: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to understand and predict the gestures based on visual cues.
